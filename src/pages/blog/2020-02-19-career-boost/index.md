I became a software engineer by way of data science and analytics - managing to leverage myself into a tech career even though I never studied computer science in school! There are tons of excellent resources I found helpful along the way at different stages of my journey and I'm often asked for recommendations from others breaking into the field. Here's what I found helpful at each stage:

1. [**Data Analytics** (SQL, Tableau)](#step1)
2. [**Data Science** (Python, R, machine learning)](#step2)
3. [**Software Engineering** (computer science books and courses)](#step3)

## Data Analytics <a name=step1></a>

The year was 2015 and I was working as a customer service rep for a tech company. I had just found out that the only business analyst at the company at that time hadn't studied anything mathy in school either - she had a degree in Spanish! I thought that if she could teach herself enough to transition to an analyst role - then I could to!

#### 1) Learn about relational databases
As I set off to teach myself SQL, the first piece of advice given to me was to build a really solid understanding of relational databases first. So I audited an online Stanford course called [Intro to Databases](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/db/2014_1/about). 

#### 2) Learn SQL and start using it! 
Next I taught myself basic SQL syntax using free online resources like [sqlteaching.com](https://www.sqlteaching.com/), affordable online courses and a [General Assembly workshop](https://generalassemb.ly/blog/sql-using-data-science-to-boost-business-and-increase-efficiency/). Some SQL course online you might find interesting include:

- [PluralSight Try SQL](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/code-school-try-sql)
- [DataCamp Intro to SQL](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-sql)
- [HackerRank SQL challenges (free practice)](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql)
- [SQL Zoo (free practice)](https://sqlzoo.net/)

While the resouces above are helpful in practicing the syntax, I probably wouldn't have stuck with it if I had not started using SQL regularly at work to answer practical questions. If you don't have access to some sort of SQL database already, it's pretty easy to [set up your own Postgres database on your mac](https://www.codementor.io/@engineerapart/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-mac-osx-are8jcopb). What would you put in this database you ask? Well, my friend - read on!

#### 3) Work on an actual data project
I always caution against spending too much time in the online courses and toy example tutorials but try to move on pretty quickly to actual projects that you are interested in. There is an increasingly large set of public data sets that contain some super interesting stuff! So, **start with a question that you're interested in**
and see if you can get your hands on relevant data! Some public data sources I've found helpful include:

- [Google's Dataset Search Engine](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
- Check if your city has a public data portal like [Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) (where I lived at the time)
- [Data World](https://data.world/)
- [Awesome list of public datasets on someone's github](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)

#### 4) Visualize the results of your analysis and share with the world!
In most contexts, raw data or results of a fancy SQL query are not actionable or valuable in an of themselves. The superpower of an analyst is being able to take data and transform it to something that humans can easily understand. It's an art - storytelling in science - where you're able to paint a picture of the way the world is and empower people with relevant and actionable information.

My tool of choice for data visualization is [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training/20201), a visual drag-and-drop interface for composing interactive dashboards - often build off a SQL query when connected to a database backend. Many companies use Tableau, but you can also **use it for free** in personal projects using [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/). 

For example, when my husband and I learned we may be moving to London, I wanted to get my arms around the different boroughs and rental prices so I found some open data on [data.london.gov.uk](https://data.london.gov.uk/) and made a [dashboard to explore London rental prices and crime data side by side](https://public.tableau.com/profile/tiffany.moeller#!/vizhome/2017LondonRentalPrices/PricesandCrimeRates).
